				<p>I have become a lot more interested in the specific fields of Website Design and Development, along with the Design and Development of video games. I would love to be exposed to a real environment where all of this happens and gain knowledge for these fields with first-hand experience. My current experience involves me using video tutorials and other methods on learning how all kinds of games and websites are made up to this date.</p><br/>
				<p>I have recently taught myself coding languages such as HTML and CSS along with a bit of JavaScript and C#.</p><br/>
				<p>I aim to learn more complex coding languages such as fully learning JavaScript, and also jQuery in a way that I can implement into Web Deisgn. I would also like to learn more C#. I will devote my time to whatever I can do during my current Apprenticeship, and learning these new languages and skills that will help me in the Game/Website Development Environment.</p>
