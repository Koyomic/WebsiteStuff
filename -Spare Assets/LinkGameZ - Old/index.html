			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>I have become a lot more interested in the specific fields of Website Design and Development, along with the Design and Development of video games. I would love to be exposed to a real environment where all of this happens and gain knowledge for these fields with first-hand experience. My current experience involves me using video tutorials and other methods on learning how all kinds of games and websites are made up to this date.</p>
			<p>I have recently taught myself coding languages such as HTML and CSS along with a bit of JavaScript and C#.</p>
			<p>I aim to learn more complex coding languages such as fully learning JavaScript, and also jQuery in a way that I can implement into Web Deisgn. I would also like to learn more C#. I will devote my time to whatever I can do during my current Apprenticeship, and learning these new languages and skills that will help me in the Game/Website Development Environment.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<h4>Communications and Trading Ltd - Web Support Apprentice</h4>
			<h2>2015 August - Current</h2>
			<p>After I finished my college courses, I decided to pursue the path of an Apprenticeship, I immediately applied to Creative Process Digital who are currently my training provider, after about 3 interviews given to me by them, I was offered a job at CAT Ltd in the role of a Web Support Apprentice. Here I am studying to achieve a Level 3 Certificate in Creative and Digital Media.</p>
			<p>My main roles right now are managing stock within our e-commerce system, called eSellerPro, now known as Volo, managing the listings that are visible to the public and reviewing orders before they are dispatched.</p>
			<p>Although my job role is Web Support Apprentice, my current position stretches out much further than this, I am learning a whole set of skills you wouldn’t normally learn in this sort of position. I have also been assigned to Customer Service, through both the phones and our online Chat called Zopim, which is something I was not expecting, but it’s very good for product knowledge and knowing about what types of problems customers have most frequently.</p>
			<p>Occasionally I work in dispatch, printing labels and being the last line of order verification before they are shipped out, responsibilities can be things like changing addresses to be compatible with the labels, making sure the correct shipping services are being used, and finally, making sure the right items is sent to the right person.</p>

    	<h4>Master of Malt - IT Support Assistant</h4>
			<h2>2013 Summer Break: July - September</h2>
			<h2>2014 Summer Break: July - September</h2>
			<p>During this time, i was still in education, but decided to use my summer breaks to work at my fathers company. I worked in a warehouse for a liquor company called Master of Malt. For the majority of this job I was labelling bottles and stacking shelves. After a month of working in this field my Manager asked me about my key skills, and so I got moved into the IT Department.</p>
			<p>My first jobs in the IT Department was to archive emails in over 50 mailboxes and making sure all the machines in the building were functioning properly. If something was to break I would be the person they'd ask for help. Large projects I had included setting up over 100 phones (both Soft phones and Hard phones) in the building and putting together several computers for customer service to get ready for new employees coming in for the Christmas holidays. Some of the key jobs I did are listed below.</p>
			<ul class="detailList">
	    	<li>Putting together desktop computers from scratch.</li>
	    	<li>Maintaining and replacing the hardware.</li>
	    	<li>Installing Windows 7 and Microsoft on these computers. Along with other software.</li>
	    	<li>Connecting these to the Network and Domain.</li>
	    	<li>Connecting to Virtual Host Servers and using Remote Desktop Connections to connect to the virtual Machines.</li>
	    	<li>Fixing HP Printers on a daily basis.</li>
  		</ul>

			<h3>Digital Artwork</h3>
			<p>As a hobby, I like to do digital drawings using my Graphics tablet and a Drawing application called Paint Tool SAI. Below are some examples of larger drawings I've done. I had more drawings but they were much smaller scale and for me, not worthy enough to publically show.</p>

			<h3>Game Projects</h3>
			<p>When my interest in game development came around, I turned to the Unity Game Developer, a very popular and widely used game engine by both Expert Developers and Beginner Developers. I used an online course to learn the basic assets of Unity, and to also learn basic programming techniques using C#, this game me a much better understanding on how programming in games worked. Below I have listed a few projects i made while i was starting out, these were made about a year ago. Recentally I have been working on expanding my skills, such as Music and 3D Modelling, which i will come back to and present at a later date.</p>

			<h4>Block Breaker</h4>
			<p>Block Breaker is a simple 'Destroy all the Bricks to win' game, the skills on how to made this I learnt on the Unity online, and then used them skills, such as basic programming and control of the Unity Engine, in the space of about 3 days.</p>
			<p>Although this is a basic game, this gave me a starting point to how the Unity interface works, like changing sprites and collision. I would like to make some better functionality like introducing a life system, with an indicator in a corner of the screen listing how many lives you have left, and not ending the game until you run out. I could also introduce powerups that do things like give you a bonus life, explosive contact on bricks, and speedups.</p>
			<p>On a side note, I do not own any music or images in this game. The rights go to their respective owners.</p>
			<p>I would like to make a developed version of this game soon once I am more comfortable with the skills I learnt while making this version.</p>

			<h4>Aerial Ace</h4>
			<p>Aerial Ace is a small survival game where the user uses the Arrow keys to move around their player and avoid the projectiles that are coming their way. Over the course of 90 seconds, the Projectile Fire Rate increases and it becomes harder to survive. Once the 90 seconds are up, a gold ring appears for the player to move towards and end the game.</p>
			<p>Thanks to Block Breaker, I felt a lot more comfortable using the unity interface this time around. I have my basic menu screen along with an insctructions screen to tell the player how to play the game, I was even introduced to animation.</p>
			<p>I will most certainly come back to this game, I intended to have multiple levels instead of just the one, but due to my heavy workload, I had to cut it short. When I come back to this game there are many things I wish to add. For example, a score system, actual enemies to attack, the ability to shoot back and some more fancy animation.</p>
